			<h2> Good Choice! </h2>
			<p> You chose a boat representing an old, famous ship the Mayflower! It is one one of the most important
				ships in American history. <br>
				This cargo ship brought the pilgrims to Massachusetts during the Great Puritan Migration in the 17th
				century.<br>
				Although the other boat looked beautiful, it was inspired by the Titanic, a steamship that sank in
				April, 1912, <br>
				off the coast of Newfoundland in the North Atlantic after sideswiping an iceberg during its maiden
				voyage. </p>
