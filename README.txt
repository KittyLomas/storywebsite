This is an interactive story website for children aged 13 and under that I created in 2018. It tells the story titled "Where the Wild Things Are" by Maurice Sendak. The folder contains a PDF of the original story labelled 'story.pdf'. The interactive website intends to convey a life lesson that Sendak teaches readers through her novel: That we should not judge someone (or something) by his or her appearance. 

The website design work is entirely my own, I did not implement any templates or themes or CSS frameworks. All the images in the ‘images’ folder I created myself using Adobe Illustrator. 

The interactive website works best on a Chrome browser. To launch the story, open the index.html file in a Chrome browser.
