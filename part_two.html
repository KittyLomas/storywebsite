			<h2> Good Choice! </h2>
			<p> Congratulations! Although the snake appears harmful, it is the milk snake! Milk snakes are completely
				harmless and can often tolerate being handled without showing much aggression. Although the frog looked
				innocent, it is lucky you did not choose it as it is Golden Poision Frog, considered one of the most
				toxic animals on Earth! A single specimen measuring two inches has enough venom to kill ten grown men.

			<h2> Unlucky! </h2>
			<p> Oh no! Although the frog appeared cute, it is the Golden Poision Frog, considered one of the most toxic
				animals on Earth! A single specimen measuring two inches has enough venom to kill ten grown men. You
				should have chosen the snake as even though the snake appears harmful, it is the milk snake! Milk snakes
				are completely harmless and can often tolerate being handled without showing much aggression. Bad luck!
