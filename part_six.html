			<h2> Good Choice! </h2>
			<p> You chose the frilld shark! Although it looks dangerous it is harmless to humans - the only causes of
				the frilld shark causing harm to people are scientists who have accidentally cut themselves! The frilld
				shark lives as deep as 1, 570m in the ocean! Although the other option appeared harmless, it is the
				puffer fish! The puffer fish has long poisonous spikes that cover its body when it feels threatened. The
				spikes as they are highly toxic to humans! </p>
